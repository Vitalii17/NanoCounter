     \class XQVibra

     \brief The XQVibra class is used to control the device's vibra. The XQVibra
     class provides also information of vibration setting in the user profile.

     Example:
     \code
     XQVibra *vibra = new XQVibra(this);
     QPushButton *startButton = new QPushButton(this);
     QPushButton *stopButton = new QPushButton(this);
     connect(startButton, SIGNAL(clicked()), vibra, SLOT(start()));
     connect(stopButton, SIGNAL(clicked()), vibra, SLOT(stop()));
     \endcode
 */

/*! \var XQVibra::InfiniteDuration
     With this constant vibration can be set to work indefinitely (Note! Depends on the HW)
 */
/*! \var XQVibra::MaxIntensity
     Maximum intensity as percentages
 */
/*! \var XQVibra::MinIntensity
     Minimum intensity as percentages
 */

/*!
     Constructs a XQVibra object with the given parent.
     Call error() to get a value of XQVibra::Error that indicates which error occurred during initialisation if any.
     \sa start(), setIntensity(), error()
